🧪 Test 1: Basic Fact-Checking with Structured Output
================================================================================

📝 Checking: SpaceX-Starship space program Flight Test Missions As of FT-9 on 2025-07-05, the ninth test has successfully achieved manned flight testing of STARSHIP.
------------------------------------------------------------

📊 Analysis Results:
   Is Factual: ❌ FALSE
   Confidence: 95.00%
   Sources: 20

   Reasoning: The statement claims that the ninth flight test (FT-9) of SpaceX's Starship, as of July 5, 2025, successfully achieved manned flight testing. However, multiple reliable sources indicate that the ninth flight test occurred on May 27, 2025, not July 5, 2025. Furthermore, the FT-9 was an integrated orbital flight test that ended in failure, with the Starship and Super Heavy booster being destroyed due to loss of control caused by a fuel leak. There was no manned flight involved in this test; it was an unmanned test flight. Therefore, the claim that FT-9 successfully achieved manned flight testing is incorrect.

   Recommendation: The statement should be corrected to reflect that the ninth Starship flight test was unmanned, occurred on May 27, 2025, and ended in failure with the destruction of the vehicle. It did not achieve successful manned flight testing as claimed.
