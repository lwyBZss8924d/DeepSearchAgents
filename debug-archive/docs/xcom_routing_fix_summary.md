# XcomScraper Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
The DeepSearchAgents CodeAct Agent was incorrectly routing non-X.com URLs to XcomScraper when attempting to use the `read_url` tool. This caused errors like:
```
URL 'https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/grok-4' is not a valid X.com or Twitter URL
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Overly Broad URL Detection**: The `is_x_url()` method used a simple regex that matched "x.com" or "twitter.com" anywhere in the URL, causing false positives for URLs like `https://github.com/x.com`.

2. **Incorrect Scraper Selection Logic**: When JinaReader and Firecrawl scrapers were unavailable (no API keys), XcomScraper was being selected as the only available scraper for ALL URLs, not just X.com URLs.

3. **Missing Priority Exclusion**: XcomScraper was not properly excluded from the default provider priority list in AUTO mode.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved URL Detection Regex
```python
# Before:
return bool(re.search(r'(twitter\.com|x\.com)', url))

# After:
return bool(re.search(
    r'^https?://(?:[\w\-]+\.)?(?:twitter\.com|x\.com)(?:/|$)',
    url
))
```

This now properly matches only URLs where x.com or twitter.com is the actual domain.

### 2. Fixed Scraper Selection Logic
Updated `_select_scraper()` in `scrape_url.py` to:
- Check if XcomScraper should handle the URL before returning it
- Skip XcomScraper for non-X.com URLs even in the priority loop

```python
# Special check: Don't use XcomScraper for non-X.com URLs
if provider == ScraperProvider.XCOM:
    # Only use XcomScraper if it's an X.com URL
    if XcomScraper.is_x_url(url):
        return scraper
    else:
        # Skip XcomScraper for non-X.com URLs
        continue
```

### 3. Updated Default Provider Priority
Excluded XCOM from the default provider priority list:
```python
self.provider_priority = provider_priority or [
    ScraperProvider.JINA,
    ScraperProvider.FIRECRAWL,
    # XCOM is excluded from auto selection
    # It will only be used for X.com URLs or when explicitly requested
]
```

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

1. **URL Detection Tests**: Verify correct identification of X.com/Twitter URLs
2. **Routing Tests**: Ensure X.com URLs go to XcomScraper, others don't
3. **Fallback Tests**: Verify proper fallback behavior when scrapers fail
4. **Priority Tests**: Confirm XCOM is excluded from default priority
5. **Edge Case Tests**: Handle subdomains, invalid URLs, etc.

## Files Modified

1. `/src/core/scraping/scraper_xcom.py` - Fixed `is_x_url()` regex
2. `/src/core/scraping/scrape_url.py` - Fixed scraper selection logic and priority

## Files Created

1. `/tests/test_readurl_routing.py` - Mock-based unit tests
2. `/tests/test_readurl_routing_integration.py` - Integration tests
3. `/tests/test_xcom_routing_fix.py` - Focused tests for the fix

## Result

The `read_url` tool now correctly:
- Routes X.com/Twitter URLs to XcomScraper
- Routes all other URLs to JinaReader or Firecrawl
- Never uses XcomScraper for non-X.com URLs
- Falls back appropriately when scrapers fail
