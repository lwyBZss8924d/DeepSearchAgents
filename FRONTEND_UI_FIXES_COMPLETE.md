# Frontend UI Display Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PlanningStep Display Issues ✅
**Problem**: 
- Empty "Initial plan" & "Update plan" messages in ChaBox
- Planning step metadata incorrectly placed after ActionStep thoughts

**Solution**:
- Fixed `src/api/v2/web_ui.py` to properly send planning content even in streaming mode
- Added special CSS styling for planning messages with blue accent border
- Planning messages now display with proper content and timing

### 2. ActionStep Duplication Issues ✅
**Problem**:
- Python code from "webide" was duplicated in ChaBox
- Terminal outputs (bash content) were duplicated in ChaBox

**Solution**:
- Enhanced filter logic in `chat-message.tsx` to explicitly exclude messages with `metadata.component === "webide"` or `metadata.component === "terminal"`
- Added debug logging to track filtered messages
- Fixed all references from `message.id` to `message.message_id` to match DSAgentRunMessage type

### 3. FinalAnswerStep Display Issues ✅
**Problem**:
- Showed raw JSON instead of formatted view with title, markdown content, and sources

**Solution**:
- Created new `FinalAnswerDisplay` component that:
  - Parses JSON content from final answer messages
  - Displays formatted title, markdown content, and sources
  - Uses a green-themed card design with proper icons
- Integrated `isFinalAnswer` check in chat-message.tsx to use the new component

## Visual Improvements

### Planning Messages

- Proper content is shown instead of empty messages

### Final Answers

## Testing Checklist

✅ Planning messages display with content
✅ Planning messages appear before action steps
✅ Python code only appears in webide
✅ Terminal outputs only appear in terminal
✅ Final answers show formatted content (not raw JSON)
✅ All message types have proper styling
✅ Debug logs help track message routing

## Debug Output

When messages are filtered, you'll see console logs like:
```
[ChatMessage] Filtering out message with component: webide
[ChatMessage] Filtering out message with component: terminal
```

This helps verify that the routing is working correctly.
