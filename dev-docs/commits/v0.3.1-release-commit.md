# feat!: Add modular scraping architecture and X.com Deep Q&A toolkit

## Summary

This major feature release introduces a modular scraping architecture with multiple provider support and comprehensive X.com integration through the Deep Q&A toolkit. The refactored scraping system provides better error handling, automatic provider selection, and cleaner abstractions for web content extraction.

## Breaking Changes

- **Scraping API Refactored**: The old monolithic `scraper.py` and `xcom_scraper.py` have been replaced with a modular architecture
  - Old import: `from src.core.scraping.scraper import Scraper`
  - New import: `from src.core.scraping.scrape_url import ScrapeUrl`
- Import paths for scraping functionality must be updated throughout the codebase

## Features Added

### Modular Scraping Architecture
- Implemented `BaseScraper` abstraction for consistent scraper interface
- Added `FirecrawlScraper` for advanced web extraction with JavaScript rendering
- Added `JinaReaderScraper` for LLM-optimized content extraction
- Refactored `XcomScraper` to use the new modular architecture
- Automatic provider selection based on URL type and available API keys
- Improved error handling with HTML content filtering

### X.com Deep Q&A Toolkit
- Implemented `XcomDeepQATool` for deep Twitter/X.com content analysis
- Added `XAILiveSearchClient` wrapper for xAI's Live Search API
- Support for three operations:
  - `search`: Search X.com posts and profiles
  - `read`: Read specific X.com URLs
  - `query`: Ask questions about X.com content
- Integrated with the toolbox system for seamless agent access

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Clean error messages instead of raw HTML content
- Specific handling for CloudFlare 524 timeout errors
- Consistent error response format across all scrapers
- Better fallback behavior when primary scrapers fail

### Documentation and Testing
- Added comprehensive documentation for X.com routing fix
- Updated README with new v0.3.1 features
- Created detailed CHANGELOG and RELEASE_NOTES
- Fixed repository format validation tests
