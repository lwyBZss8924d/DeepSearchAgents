# Fix Mermaid Architecture Diagram Consistency Between EN and ZH README

## Summary
Fixed mermaid architecture diagram inconsistencies between English and Chinese README files, ensuring unified visual style and connection formatting across both versions.

## Changes Made

### 1. README_Zh.md - Chinese Version Architecture Diagram Fixes
- **Node Format Alignment**: 
  - Fixed `Python环境` node from `(())` double parentheses to `[()]` bracket-parentheses format
  - Updated `MCPServer` label from "MCP 服务" to "MCP 服务 (FastMCP)" 
  - Fixed `CoreAgents` node description formatting to match English version multiline format

- **Connection Line Standardization**:
  - Converted all curved connection lines `-.->` to straight angular lines `-->`
  - Updated 9 connection lines total:
    - `外部API --> 工具箱集合` (ExternalAPIs to Toolbox)
    - All streaming output connections (Agent to CLI/GaiaUI)
    - Final answer connections (Agent to CoreAgents)
    - Response connections (CoreAgents to Interfaces/MCPServer)

- **Missing Connection Lines**:
  - Added missing `核心专员 -- "工具结果" --> MCPServer` connection line

- **Style Class Definitions**:
  - Added missing `classDef mcpserver` style definition
  - Applied correct `MCPServer:::mcpserver` style assignment

### 2. README.md - English Version Architecture Diagram Fixes  
- **Connection Line Standardization**: 
  - Converted all curved connection lines `-.->` to straight angular lines `-->`
  - Updated same 9 connection lines to maintain consistency with Chinese version
  - Ensured all connection types use unified straight-line formatting

### 3. Connection Line Style Unification
**Before**: Mixed connection styles
- Curved lines: `-.->` (dotted curved arrows)
- Straight lines: `-->` (straight arrows)
- Thick lines: `==>` (thick straight arrows)

**After**: Unified straight-line styling
- Regular connections: `-->` (straight arrows)
- Thick connections: `==>` (thick straight arrows)  
- All connections now use angular/straight line routing

## Technical Impact
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: Both language versions now render identical mermaid diagrams
- ✅ **Professional Appearance**: Unified straight-line connection style throughout
- ✅ **Complete Diagram**: All connections and nodes properly defined and styled
- ✅ **Version Parity**: Chinese and English README architecture diagrams are now perfectly aligned

## Diagram Elements Fixed
1. **Node Shape Consistency**: All nodes use consistent bracket/parentheses formatting
2. **Connection Completeness**: All required connections present in both versions  
3. **Style Application**: All nodes have proper CSS class styling applied
4. **Label Accuracy**: All node labels and connection descriptions match between versions

## Quality Assurance
- Verified all 9 curved connections converted to straight lines
- Confirmed both versions have identical mermaid configuration
- Ensured all classDef styles properly defined and applied
- Validated Chinese translations maintain technical accuracy

## Related Documentation
- Architecture diagram reflects current v0.2.8 system design
- Supports both CodeAct and ToolCalling ReAct agent paradigms
- Includes new X.com integration and toolbox management features
- Shows integrated streaming support (v0.2.6+)

## Files Modified
- `README.md`: Architecture diagram connection line unification
- `README_Zh.md`: Complete architecture diagram consistency fixes
- `src/tools/toolbox.py`: Minor linting fix (line length)

This change ensures both English and Chinese documentation present a consistent, professional visual representation of the DeepSearchAgent system architecture.
