- Enhanced token counting and streaming performance

## Agent Enhancements (✅ Complete)
- Parallel tool execution support with max_tool_threads configuration
- Hierarchical agent management via ManagerAgent
- Full context manager support (sync/async) for resource cleanup
- RunResult integration for rich execution metadata

## New Features (✅ Complete)
- Structured generation for CodeAgent with configurable settings
- Enhanced memory management with reset and summary capabilities
- Research team configurations for collaborative problem-solving
- Improved CLI with manager mode and team selection

## Critical Fixes Applied
- Fixed CLI streaming display issues (removed Rich Live display)
- Enhanced streaming chunk filtering and verbosity control
- Suppressed print statements during streaming mode
- Fixed manager agent streaming and delegation reliability

## Testing & Documentation (✅ Complete)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for new features
- Updated README.md and README_Zh.md with v0.2.9 annotations
- Created detailed upgrade and issue documentation
