# Streaming Display Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Console Output Pollution During Streaming
**Problem**: Streaming chunks contained formatted console output including "Streaming Response Streaming..." messages and timing information, making the display cluttered and unreadable.

**Solution**:
- Added context manager `suppress_output()` to redirect stdout during streaming (later removed as it broke generators)
- Reduced agent verbosity level to 0 during streaming mode
- Made print statements conditional based on streaming mode and verbosity level

### 2. Repetitive Status Messages
**Problem**: The streaming display showed repetitive "Streaming Response" messages with timing information.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced chunk filtering in StreamingConsoleFormatter to detect and skip:
  - Console formatting patterns (Rich markup, ANSI codes)
  - Box drawing characters
  - Status messages containing "Streaming Response", "MultiModelRouter", etc.
- Added `_clean_chunk()` method to remove formatting artifacts

### 3. Duplicate Content Display
**Problem**: Content like "1. Facts survey" was being displayed multiple times.

**Solution**:
- Improved chunk processing to clean content before appending
- Added length checks after cleaning to skip empty chunks
- Enhanced pattern matching to filter out console-formatted content

## Code Changes

### 1. `/src/agents/base_agent.py`
```python
# Added context management imports
import sys
import io
from contextlib import contextmanager

# Added context manager (later removed)
@contextmanager
def suppress_output():
    """Context manager to suppress stdout during streaming"""
    ...

# Modified streaming mode to reduce verbosity
if stream:
    # Temporarily reduce verbosity during streaming
    if hasattr(self.agent, 'verbosity_level'):
        original_verbosity = self.agent.verbosity_level
        self.agent.verbosity_level = 0
```

### 2. `/src/agents/codact_agent.py`
```python
# Made initialization prints conditional
if not self.enable_streaming or self.verbosity_level >= 2:
    print(f"DeepSearch CodeAct agent initialized successfully...")
    
# Suppressed warning in streaming mode
if self.enable_streaming:
    if self.verbosity_level >= 2:
        print("Warning: Streaming mode is temporarily disabled...")
```

### 3. `/src/agents/ui_common/streaming_formatter.py`
```python
# Added comprehensive chunk cleaning
def _clean_chunk(self, chunk_str: str) -> str:
    """Clean console formatting from chunk"""
    # Remove ANSI escape codes
    ansi_escape = re.compile(r'\x1B(?:[@-Z\\-_]|\[[0-?]*[ -/]*[@-~])')
    chunk_str = ansi_escape.sub('', chunk_str)
    
    # Remove Rich markup
    rich_markup = re.compile(r'\[/?[a-zA-Z0-9_]+\]')
    chunk_str = rich_markup.sub('', chunk_str)
    
    # Remove box drawing characters
    box_chars = "━╭─│╰┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼"
    for char in box_chars:
        chunk_str = chunk_str.replace(char, '')
        
    return chunk_str.strip()

# Enhanced skip patterns
skip_patterns = [
    "Streaming Response",
    "Streaming...",
    "[dim]", "[/dim]",
    "MultiModelRouter",
    "openai/claude",
    "━━━", "╭─", "│", "╰─",
    "New run"
]
```

## Testing Results

- ✅ CodeAct agent streaming works correctly with clean output
- ✅ Console output is suppressed during streaming when verbosity is low
- ✅ Streaming chunks are properly filtered and cleaned
- ⚠️ Manager agent streaming may still have issues due to complexity of sub-agent calls

## Future Improvements

1. **Better Streaming Architecture**: Consider refactoring to ensure streaming output is completely separate from console display
2. **Unified Verbosity Control**: Add global streaming verbosity settings in config
3. **Enhanced Chunk Detection**: Use more sophisticated parsing to detect actual content vs. formatting
4. **Manager Agent Optimization**: Special handling for manager agent streaming to avoid sub-agent output pollution
