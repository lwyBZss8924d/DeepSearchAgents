# Manager Agent Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the ManagerAgent to align with smolagents v0.1.19 design principles, changing it from a ReactAgent-based tool-calling orchestrator to a CodeAgent-based dynamic orchestrator.

## Key Changes

### 1. Base Class Change
- **Before**: Extended ReactAgent (tool-calling approach)
- **After**: Extends CodeAgent (code execution approach)
- **Rationale**: Enables dynamic, LLM-driven orchestration through Python code instead of hard-coded rules

### 2. Naming Improvements
- **Manager Agent**: 
  - Before: "DeepSearch Manager Agent"
  - After: "Research Multi-Agent Team"
- **Team Members**:
  - Before: "Web Research Specialist", "Data Analysis Specialist"
  - After: "Research Team: Web Search Agent", "Research Team: Analysis Agent"
- **Rationale**: Clearly indicates hierarchical team structure

### 3. Removed Hard-Coded Logic
- **Removed Methods**:
  - `analyze_task_complexity()` - Hard-coded task analysis
  - `analyze_task()` - Rule-based delegation
  - `orchestrate_complex_task()` - Pre-programmed orchestration
  - `delegate_task()` - Fixed delegation patterns
- **Rationale**: The LLM now writes Python code to dynamically analyze tasks and delegate to sub-agents based on context

### 4. Updated Configuration
- Uses CodeAgent configuration parameters:
  - `executor_type`, `executor_kwargs`
  - `verbosity_level`, `additional_authorized_imports`
  - `use_structured_outputs_internally`
- Manager-specific settings:
  - `MANAGER_MAX_STEPS` (default: 30)
  - `MANAGER_PLANNING_INTERVAL` (default: 10)
  - `MANAGER_ENABLE_STREAMING`

### 5. CLI Updates
- Display shows "Research Team" instead of "Manager"
- Selection menu updated to "Research Multi-Agent Team"
- Features now emphasize "Code-based orchestration" and "Dynamic delegation"

## Implementation Details

### Manager Agent Creation (runtime.py)
```python
agent = ManagerAgent(
    orchestrator_model=...,
    search_model=...,
    tools=[],  # Manager doesn't use tools directly
    initial_state=initial_state,
    managed_agents=managed_agents,  # Sub-agents to orchestrate
    # CodeAgent parameters
    executor_type=settings.CODACT_EXECUTOR_TYPE,
    executor_kwargs=settings.CODACT_EXECUTOR_KWARGS,
    # ... other CodeAgent settings
)
```

### Dynamic Orchestration
The manager now receives sub-agents as callable team members in its prompt:
```python
def Research Team: Web Search Agent(task: str, additional_args: dict) -> str:
    """A team member specialized in web search..."""
    
def Research Team: Analysis Agent(task: str, additional_args: dict) -> str:
    """A team member specialized in data processing..."""
```

The LLM writes Python code to:
1. Analyze the task requirements
2. Check previous results and context
3. Decide which sub-agent(s) to invoke
4. Pass appropriate context and instructions
5. Process and synthesize results

## Benefits

1. **True LLM-Driven Orchestration**: No hard-coded rules, the LLM decides based on task and context
2. **Flexible Delegation**: Can handle complex, multi-step delegations dynamically
3. **Better Integration**: Aligns with smolagents v0.1.19 managed agents design
4. **Clearer Communication**: Naming clearly indicates team hierarchy and purpose
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new sub-agents without changing orchestration logic

## Testing

Successfully tested with simple query "What is 2+2?" - the manager correctly:
- Analyzed the task as a simple arithmetic problem
- Executed Python code to calculate the result
- Provided the correct answer without unnecessary delegation

For more complex tasks, the manager will dynamically delegate to appropriate team members based on task requirements.
