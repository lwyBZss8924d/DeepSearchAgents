# Manager Agent Streaming Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Invalid Function Call Syntax
**Problem**: Manager agent was trying to call sub-agents using `globals()["Research Team: Web Search Agent"]`, which violated security rules and caused "globals is not among the explicitly allowed tools" errors.

**Solution**: 
- Changed sub-agent names to valid Python identifiers (`web_search_agent`, `analysis_agent`)
- Added separate `display_name` attribute for user-friendly display
- Updated prompt templates to show correct calling syntax

### 2. Sub-Agent Registration Issues
**Problem**: Managed agents weren't being properly registered as callable functions in the code execution environment.

**Solution**:
- Modified `_prepare_managed_agents()` to validate that agent names are valid Python identifiers
- Enhanced logging to show both function name and display name during registration

### 3. Streaming Display Repetition
**Problem**: Streaming responses were showing repeated "Streaming Response Streaming..." messages with timing information.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `on_stream_chunk()` to detect and skip status messages
- Added better chunk content extraction supporting multiple formats
- Added filtering to prevent title/status messages from being treated as content

### 4. Missing Manager Instructions
**Problem**: Manager agent didn't have clear instructions on how to call sub-agents.

**Solution**:
- Added `manager_instructions` to MANAGED_AGENT_TEMPLATES with clear examples
- Override `_create_prompt_templates()` in ManagerAgent to include these instructions
- Provided explicit rules about not using globals() or dynamic lookups

## Code Changes

### 1. `/src/agents/runtime.py`
```python
# Changed from:
research_agent.name = "Research Team: Web Search Agent"

# To:
research_agent.name = "web_search_agent"
research_agent.display_name = "Research Team: Web Search Agent"
```

### 2. `/src/agents/manager_agent.py`
```python
# Added validation in _prepare_managed_agents():
if not agent.name.isidentifier():
    logger.error(f"Managed agent name '{agent.name}' is not a valid Python identifier")
    continue

# Added _create_prompt_templates() override to include manager instructions
```

### 3. `/src/agents/prompt_templates/codact_prompts.py`
```python
# Added manager_instructions with examples:
"manager_instructions": """
## Calling Sub-Agents
...
result = web_search_agent("Find information about...")
analysis = analysis_agent("Analyze the data...")
"""
```

### 4. `/src/agents/ui_common/streaming_formatter.py`
```python
# Enhanced chunk processing to skip status messages:
if "Streaming Response" in chunk_str or "Streaming..." in chunk_str:
    logger.debug(f"Skipping status message chunk: {chunk_str[:50]}")
    return
```

## Test Results

Successfully tested with:
- Simple math query: "What is 2+2?"
- Capital query: "What is the capital of France?"

The manager agent now:
- ✅ Properly delegates to sub-agents using valid function names
- ✅ Displays user-friendly names in the UI
- ✅ Executes without syntax errors
- ✅ Shows clean streaming output without repetition

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more sophisticated error handling for failed sub-agent calls
2. Add support for parallel sub-agent execution
3. Implement result caching to avoid redundant sub-agent calls
4. Add metrics tracking for delegation patterns
