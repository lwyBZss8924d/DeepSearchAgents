# DeepSearchAgent Periodic Planning

DeepSearchAgent v0.2.4 introduces periodic planning capability for both agent types, allowing strategic reassessment during complex search tasks.

## Concept

Periodic planning helps agents maintain focus and adapt their search strategy as they gather new information. Instead of blindly following an initial plan, agents reassess at regular intervals to:

1. Evaluate progress on the current goal
2. Identify gaps in the information collected
3. Adjust search strategy based on discoveries
4. Prioritize remaining sub-tasks

## Implementation

### ReAct Agent

In [agent.py](mdc:src/agents/agent.py), the ReAct agent implements planning with:

```python
# Set planning interval (default: 7)
planning_interval = planning_interval
```

The planning process involves:
- Initial planning at the start of a task
- Periodic planning every `planning_interval` steps
- Sending special planning prompts to the LLM to reconsider its approach

### CodeAct Agent

In [codact_agent.py](mdc:src/agents/codact_agent.py), the CodeAct agent uses:

```python
# Set planning interval (default: 5)
search_planning_interval = planning_interval
```

The CodeAct planning involves:
- Detailed strategy assessment in Python code
- State tracking for visited URLs, search queries, etc.
- Python-based plan adjustments

## Configuration

Planning intervals can be configured in:

1. [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml):
   ```yaml
   agents:
     react:
       planning_interval: 7
     codact:
       planning_interval: 5
   ```

2. Command line:
   ```bash
   # For ReAct agent
   python -m src.agents.cli --agent-type react --react-planning-interval 10
   
   # For CodeAct agent
   python -m src.agents.cli --agent-type codact --planning-interval 8
   ```

## Benefits

- More coherent search strategy over long tasks
- Better adaptation to discovered information
- Reduced "tunnel vision" where agent follows initial assumptions
- Improved handling of complex, multi-part research questions
