# DeepSearchAgent Tools

The DeepSearchAgent includes several specialized tools for web search, content processing, and analysis:

## Search Tools

- **[search.py](mdc:src/agents/tools/search.py)**: Implements web search functionality to retrieve links and snippets from search engines.
  - Uses external APIs like Serper to fetch search results
  - Returns structured data including titles, snippets, and URLs

## Content Processing Tools

- **[readurl.py](mdc:src/agents/tools/readurl.py)**: Fetches and processes web content from URLs.
  - Extracts text content from web pages
  - Uses Jina AI Reader API for parsing HTML content

- **[chunk.py](mdc:src/agents/tools/chunk.py)**: Divides text into manageable segments for processing.
  - Helps handle large documents by splitting them into smaller chunks
  - Supports semantic chunking for better context preservation

## Semantic Processing Tools

- **[embed.py](mdc:src/agents/tools/embed.py)**: Converts text segments into vector embeddings.
  - Creates vector representations of text for semantic operations
  - Supports document similarity and retrieval operations

- **[rerank.py](mdc:src/agents/tools/rerank.py)**: Ranks content segments by relevance to a query.
  - Improves search relevance by reordering content based on semantic similarity
  - Helps identify the most relevant information for a given query

## Computational Tools

- **[wolfram.py](mdc:src/agents/tools/wolfram.py)**: Interfaces with Wolfram Alpha for computational queries.
  - Answers mathematical, scientific, and factual questions
  - Processes computational problems that require specialized knowledge
