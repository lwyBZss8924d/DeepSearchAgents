# Today [2025-07-30] work task: "Debug Web UI Issues: UI-Empty-ChatBox"

## Task(1): [250730-1] "Issues-UI-Empty-ChatBox"

Currently, in the front-end Agent Chat UI, components (cards/badges) sometimes fail to display content properly or are not invoked correctly, causing an "Empty ChatBox" to appear during the Agent Run process;

1. Analyze the cause of the UI error: Analyze backend and thoroughly analyze front-end code components to identify all possible causes of the error; check whether there is a specific backend Agent Run event message triggering the "Empty ChatBox"; determine if it is due to front-end message handling errors or defects in related front-end components that fail to invoke rendering correctly.
2. Locate defective code based on error causes:
3. Write debugging scripts (joint frontend & backend debugging), reproduce/confirm the mechanism causing the error; obtain raw input/output data chains required for fixing code defects as evidence for repair.
4. Fix and modify defective code;
5. Test whether fixes meet expectations; otherwise, repeat analysis/location/diagnosis/fix/testing loop.
6. Review and summarize relevant experience from defect fixes; complete Issues Fixed.

## Task(2)

After completing Task 1 Issues Fixed, I will update and arrange new upcoming tasks.
