  - Fixed Bug 4: Completely removed ALL glamour effects from DSAgentMessageCard
- **17:46** - Build successful - All TypeScript errors resolved
- **18:00** - User reported "Good Job! is fixed 80%" - Two issues remained:

  - Final answer markdown was displaying as raw MD code instead of being rendered
- **18:05** - Researched terminal-style markdown rendering solutions using MCP context7 tool

  - Fixed double blinking cursor by preventing DSAgentStreamingText for action thoughts
  - Fixed markdown rendering by removing literal markdown syntax characters
- **18:20** - User reported one blinking cursor still remained
- **18:25** - Deep investigation revealed root cause:
  - CSS rule `[agent-state-="streaming"]::after` adds cursor to ANY streaming element
  - ActionThoughtCard was setting `state="streaming"` based on metadata
- **18:30** - Fixed by setting ActionThoughtCard to always use `state="idle"`
- **18:35** - User confirmed one cursor removed, but one still remained
- **18:40** - Further investigation found the real issue:
  - Parent DSAgentMessageCard in agent-chat.tsx was setting `state="streaming"`
  - This triggered the CSS cursor rule on the outer container
- **18:45** - Final fix: Updated agent-chat.tsx to exclude action thoughts from streaming state
- **18:50** - All bugs fixed successfully! User confirmed "Great job!"

## Debugging Experience Summary

### Key Learnings from Bug Fix Process

1. **Initial Misunderstanding**: 
   - First attempt fixed component definitions but didn't verify actual usage
   - Lesson: Always trace component usage through the entire render hierarchy

2. **Iterative Debugging Approach**:
   - User feedback with browser screenshots was crucial
   - Each "fixed" issue revealed deeper problems
   - Success came from methodical investigation of each layer

3. **CSS Cascade Complexity**:
   - Blinking cursor issue had multiple sources:
     - CSS pseudo-elements (`::after`)
     - Component state attributes
     - Parent-child component interactions
   - Fix required understanding the full component tree

4. **Component Architecture Insights**:
   - ActionThoughtCard was being rendered directly in agent-chat.tsx
   - Parent DSAgentMessageCard state affected child components
   - Streaming state propagation needed careful control

5. **Effective Debugging Tools**:
   - Git show to examine reference implementations
   - Grep with context lines to understand CSS rules
   - Reading parent components to trace prop flow
   - Building after each fix to catch TypeScript errors

### Technical Discoveries

1. **CSS Attribute Selectors**: `[agent-state-="streaming"]::after` applies globally
2. **Component State Management**: Parent state can override child state intentions
3. **Markdown Rendering**: Terminal aesthetic requires removing syntax characters
4. **Glamour Effects**: Were deeply embedded in multiple components

## Notes

- Building on frontend cleanup success
- Focus on performance-critical fixes first
- Maintain WebTUI terminal aesthetic
- Test thoroughly after each phase
- User feedback is invaluable for UI bugs

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Phase 0 Bug Fixes COMPLETED
2. ‚úÖ Fixed truncated content display bug
3. ‚úÖ Fixed final answer markdown rendering
4. ‚úÖ Removed excessive animations
5. ‚úÖ Removed tool badge glamour effects
6. ‚è≥ Proceed to Phase 1: Quick Wins (optimization)
7. ‚è≥ Fix global transition performance issue
8. ‚è≥ Remove duplicate animations
9. ‚è≥ Remove unused CSS

## Risk Mitigation

- Commit after each successful phase
- Keep original files during extraction
- Visual testing after each change
- Backup branch available: `v0.3.3-dev.250804.frontend-cleanup`
